# Feature Specification: URL Content Extractor

**Feature Branch**: `url-content-extractor`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "특정 URL을 입력하면, 해당 URL 내 본문을 추출하는 어플리케이션을 만들 거"

## Overview

An application that allows users to extract the main content from web pages by providing a URL. The system retrieves the web page, processes it, and extracts the meaningful body content while filtering out navigation, advertisements, and other non-essential elements.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Basic Content Extraction (Priority: P1)

A user wants to extract clean, readable content from a news article or blog post for easier reading or archival purposes.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value - the ability to extract and view clean content from any URL.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a URL to a standard article/blog and verifying that the extracted content contains only the main text without ads, navigation, or sidebars.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is ready, **When** a user enters a valid URL to a news article, **Then** the system displays the extracted main content (title, article body, publication date if available)
2. **Given** the user has entered a URL, **When** the extraction completes, **Then** the output contains only the meaningful content without navigation menus, advertisements, or footer elements
3. **Given** a URL has been processed, **When** the user views the extracted content, **Then** the original text formatting (paragraphs, headings) is preserved

### User Story 2 - Error Handling and Validation (Priority: P2)

A user enters an invalid URL or a URL that cannot be accessed, and the system provides clear feedback about what went wrong.

**Why this priority**: Robust error handling ensures users understand issues and can correct them, preventing frustration and building trust in the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to extract content from invalid URLs (malformed, non-existent, blocked) and verifying appropriate error messages are shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is ready, **When** a user enters a malformed URL (missing protocol, invalid format), **Then** the system displays a clear error message indicating the URL format is invalid
2. **Given** a valid URL format, **When** the URL points to a non-existent page (404) or inaccessible resource, **Then** the system informs the user that the content could not be retrieved
3. **Given** a URL that times out or fails to respond, **When** the extraction attempt exceeds the timeout limit, **Then** the system notifies the user and suggests trying again

---

### User Story 3 - Content Export and Saving (Priority: P3)

After successfully extracting content, users want to save or export the extracted text for later use.

**Why this priority**: This enhances utility by allowing users to archive or process extracted content, but the core extraction functionality (P1) must work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by extracting content from a URL and verifying that users can save the output in various formats (text, markdown, etc.).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** content has been extracted successfully, **When** the user chooses to save the content, **Then** the system allows downloading the extracted text [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What format(s) should be supported - plain text, markdown, PDF, HTML?]
2. **Given** extracted content is displayed, **When** the user wants to copy the content, **Then** the content can be easily copied to the clipboard
3. **Given** multiple URLs have been processed, **When** the user reviews their extraction history, **Then** previously extracted content can be accessed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system maintain a history of extractions?]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a URL points to a page that requires authentication or login?
- How does the system handle pages that are primarily video or image content with minimal text?
- What happens when a URL points to a PDF or other non-HTML document?
- How does the system handle pages with dynamic content loaded via JavaScript?
- What happens when the extracted content contains special characters or non-Latin scripts (Chinese, Korean, Arabic, etc.)?
- How does the system handle very large pages (e.g., lengthy documentation pages)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept URLs as input from users
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate URL format before attempting to retrieve content
- **FR-003**: System MUST retrieve the web page content from the provided URL
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract the main body content while excluding navigation, advertisements, sidebars, headers, and footers
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the semantic structure of the content (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the extracted content to the user in a readable format
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle and report errors when URLs are invalid, inaccessible, or retrieval fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST support common URL protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle timeout scenarios when pages are slow to respond
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to initiate a new extraction after completing or viewing a previous one
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle content in multiple languages and character encodings (UTF-8, etc.)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide feedback during the extraction process (loading indicator) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the acceptable wait time for extraction - should there be progress indicators for slow pages?]

### Key Entities

- **URL Input**: The web address provided by the user that points to the content to be extracted
- **Web Page Content**: The raw HTML/content retrieved from the URL
- **Extracted Content**: The processed, cleaned main body text extracted from the web page, including title, body text, and metadata (author, date if available)
- **Extraction Result**: The output containing either successfully extracted content or error information

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully extract readable content from 95% of standard article and blog URLs
- **SC-002**: Content extraction completes within 10 seconds for typical web pages
- **SC-003**: Extracted content excludes at least 90% of non-relevant elements (ads, navigation, footers) from typical websites
- **SC-004**: Users can complete the entire flow (input URL → view extracted content) in under 30 seconds
- **SC-005**: Error messages are clear enough that 90% of users understand what went wrong without additional help
- **SC-006**: Extracted content maintains readability and structure comparable to reading the original article

## Dependencies

- Access to external websites (requires internet connectivity)
- Ability to make HTTP/HTTPS requests to third-party URLs
- Web content must be publicly accessible (pages behind authentication may not be supported)

## Assumptions

- Users will primarily extract content from publicly accessible web pages
- Most target content will be standard HTML articles, blog posts, and news content
- The application will run in an environment with internet access
- Default export format will be plain text unless user specifies otherwise
- Extraction history is optional and not required for MVP (see User Story 3)
- System will handle standard timeout of 30 seconds for page retrieval
- Content will be displayed in-application unless export functionality is implemented

## Out of Scope

- Extracting content from pages requiring user authentication or login
- Processing or extracting content from video or audio media
- Real-time monitoring or scheduled extraction of URLs
- Browser extension or bookmarklet integration
- OCR or extraction from images
- Batch processing of multiple URLs simultaneously (single URL at a time for MVP)

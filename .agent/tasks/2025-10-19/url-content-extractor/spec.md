# Feature Specification: URL Content Extractor

**Feature Branch**: `url-content-extractor`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "url을 입력하면, 해당 웹 사이트의 본문을 출력하는 어플리케이션 만들어줘"

## Overview

A simple application that extracts and displays the main content from any web page when given a URL. The application filters out navigation menus, advertisements, footers, and other non-essential elements to present only the core readable content of the page.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Extract Basic Web Content (Priority: P1)

A user wants to read the main article or content from a web page without distractions like ads, sidebars, and navigation menus. They provide a URL and receive clean, readable text content.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value - the ability to extract and view clean content from any standard web page. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a URL to a news article or blog post and verifying that the main text content is extracted and displayed while ads, navigation, and sidebars are excluded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid URL to a blog post, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the application displays the blog post title and main content text
2. **Given** a valid URL to a news article, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the application displays only the article content without ads or navigation elements
3. **Given** a URL to a simple webpage with clear main content, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the content is extracted and displayed within 5 seconds

### User Story 2 - Handle Invalid URLs and Errors (Priority: P2)

A user attempts to extract content from URLs that are invalid, inaccessible, or don't contain extractable content. The application provides clear feedback about what went wrong.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability and preventing confusion when things don't work as expected. Users need to understand why content extraction failed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing invalid URLs, unreachable domains, or pages without content, and verifying appropriate error messages are shown for each case.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invalid URL format (missing protocol, malformed), **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the application displays a clear error message indicating the URL format is invalid
2. **Given** a URL to a non-existent domain, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the application displays an error message indicating the page cannot be reached
3. **Given** a URL that requires authentication, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the application displays an error message indicating access is restricted

### User Story 3 - View Formatted Content (Priority: P3)

A user wants to view the extracted content in a readable format that preserves basic structure like paragraphs, headings, and lists for better comprehension.

**Why this priority**: Enhances readability and user experience but the basic extraction (P1) already delivers core value. This is an improvement on top of the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by extracting content from pages with structured content (headings, lists, paragraphs) and verifying that the structure is preserved in the output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a URL with content that has headings, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the headings are clearly distinguished from body text in the output
2. **Given** a URL with bulleted or numbered lists, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** the lists are displayed with proper formatting
3. **Given** a URL with multiple paragraphs, **When** user inputs the URL, **Then** paragraph breaks are preserved in the output

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a URL points to a PDF, image, or video file instead of a web page?
- How does the system handle extremely large pages (e.g., 10MB+ of content)?
- What happens when a page has multiple possible "main content" areas?
- How does the system handle pages that are heavily JavaScript-dependent for content rendering?
- What happens when a page uses non-standard encoding or special characters?
- How does the system handle redirects (3xx status codes)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a URL as input from the user
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate URL format before attempting to fetch content
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch the web page content from the provided URL
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract the main content area from the fetched page, excluding navigation, advertisements, footers, and sidebars
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the extracted content to the user in a readable format
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid URLs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages for unreachable URLs
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when content cannot be extracted
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve basic text structure (paragraphs, headings, lists) in the extracted content
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle standard character encodings (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle HTTP redirects (301, 302 status codes)

### Key Entities

- **URL Request**: Represents a user's request to extract content, containing the target URL and validation status
- **Web Content**: Represents the fetched raw HTML content from the target URL
- **Extracted Content**: Represents the cleaned and processed main content, including text and basic structure

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully extract readable content from 90% of standard news articles and blog posts
- **SC-002**: Content extraction completes within 10 seconds for pages up to 1MB in size
- **SC-003**: Users receive clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios (invalid URL, network errors, extraction failures)
- **SC-004**: Extracted content excludes navigation, advertisements, and non-content elements in 85% of test cases
- **SC-005**: Users can complete the entire flow (input URL → view content) in under 30 seconds
- **SC-006**: Basic text structure (headings, paragraphs, lists) is preserved in the extracted output

## Assumptions

- Users will primarily target standard web pages (blogs, news articles, documentation) rather than highly dynamic single-page applications
- Content extraction uses heuristic-based or library-based approaches (similar to reader modes in browsers)
- The application operates on publicly accessible URLs that don't require authentication
- Network connectivity is available for fetching remote content
- The application handles standard HTTP responses and doesn't require JavaScript rendering for basic content extraction

## Out of Scope

- Authentication or handling of password-protected content
- Extraction of content from PDFs, images, or non-HTML documents
- Saving or bookmarking extracted content for later viewing
- User accounts or personalization features
- Downloading or archiving web pages
- Rendering JavaScript-heavy single-page applications
- Translation or summarization of extracted content
- Browser extension or mobile app versions

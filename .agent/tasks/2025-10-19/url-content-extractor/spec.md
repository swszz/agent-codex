# Feature Specification: URL Content Extractor

**Feature Branch**: `url-content-extractor`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "url을 입력하면, 해당 웹 사이트의 본문을 출력하는 어플리케이션 만들어줘"

## Overview

A web content extraction application that accepts URLs as input and outputs the main body content of web pages. The application extracts clean, readable content from web pages while filtering out navigation elements, advertisements, sidebars, and other non-essential page elements to present only the core content to users.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Content Extraction (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to paste a URL and immediately see the main content of that webpage so I can read articles without distractions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - extracting and displaying readable content from any URL. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a valid URL (e.g., news article, blog post) and verifying that the main text content is displayed without navigation menus, ads, or sidebars, delivering immediate reading value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they enter a valid URL of a blog article and submit, **Then** the main article text is displayed without navigation bars, comments sections, or advertisements
2. **Given** a user has entered a URL, **When** the content is being extracted, **Then** they see a loading indicator showing progress
3. **Given** a user views extracted content, **When** the content includes paragraphs and headings, **Then** the text formatting and structure are preserved for readability

### User Story 2 - URL Validation and Error Handling (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want clear feedback when I enter an invalid URL or when content cannot be extracted so I understand what went wrong and can take corrective action.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience and preventing confusion, but the application can technically function without sophisticated error handling in an MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by entering various invalid inputs (malformed URLs, unreachable sites, pages without content) and verifying appropriate error messages are shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user enters a malformed URL (missing protocol, invalid format), **When** they submit, **Then** they see a clear error message explaining the URL format is invalid
2. **Given** a user enters a URL to a non-existent website, **When** the extraction fails, **Then** they see an error message indicating the site could not be reached
3. **Given** a user enters a URL to a page with no extractable content, **When** extraction completes, **Then** they see a message indicating no main content was found

### User Story 3 - Content Export and Sharing (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to copy or export the extracted content so I can save it for later reading or share it with others.

**Why this priority**: Enhances utility but not required for basic content extraction functionality. Users can manually copy text even without dedicated export features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by extracting content from a URL and verifying that users can easily copy the text or download it in a readable format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** extracted content is displayed, **When** the user clicks a "Copy" button, **Then** the full extracted text is copied to their clipboard
2. **Given** extracted content is displayed, **When** the user selects text manually, **Then** they can copy selected portions using standard copy commands
3. **Given** extracted content is displayed, **When** the user requests a download, **Then** the content is saved as a plain text file with the page title as the filename

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a URL requires authentication or is behind a paywall?
- How does the system handle pages with dynamic content loaded via JavaScript?
- What happens when a URL redirects to another page?
- How does the system handle very large pages (e.g., 10,000+ words)?
- What happens when extracting content from non-HTML pages (PDFs, images, etc.)?
- How does the system handle pages in different languages or character encodings?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept URL input from users in a text input field
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate URL format before attempting extraction
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract main body content from valid HTML web pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter out navigation elements, headers, footers, sidebars, and advertisements from extracted content
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve content structure including paragraphs, headings, and lists
- **FR-006**: System MUST display extracted content in a readable format
- **FR-007**: System MUST show loading indicators during content extraction
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle network errors and unreachable URLs gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid URLs or extraction failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to copy extracted content to clipboard
- **FR-011**: System MUST support common URL protocols (http, https)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle URL redirects transparently

### Key Entities

- **URL Request**: Represents a user's content extraction request, containing the target URL and extraction status
- **Extracted Content**: The main body text and structure extracted from a web page, including headings, paragraphs, and formatting
- **Extraction Result**: The outcome of an extraction attempt, including success/failure status, content (if successful), and error details (if failed)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can extract and view content from a URL in under 5 seconds for typical web pages (articles, blog posts)
- **SC-002**: System successfully extracts readable main content from at least 90% of standard article/blog pages
- **SC-003**: Users can complete the full workflow (enter URL, view content, copy text) in under 30 seconds
- **SC-004**: Extracted content contains only main body text without navigation, ads, or sidebars in 95% of successful extractions
- **SC-005**: Users receive clear, actionable error messages for 100% of failed extraction attempts
- **SC-006**: System handles at least 100 concurrent extraction requests without performance degradation

## Assumptions

- Users have internet connectivity to access web pages
- Most target URLs will be publicly accessible web pages (not behind authentication)
- Target web pages are primarily HTML-based content (not single-page applications with heavy JavaScript rendering)
- Users want plain text content extraction rather than styled/formatted output
- Content extraction does not need to preserve images, videos, or interactive elements
- The application will be used primarily for reading articles, blog posts, and similar text-heavy content

## Out of Scope

- Authentication to access password-protected content
- Extracting content from JavaScript-heavy single-page applications requiring full browser rendering
- Preserving or displaying images, videos, and multimedia content
- Converting or extracting content from non-HTML formats (PDFs, Word documents)
- Storing extraction history or user preferences
- Batch processing of multiple URLs simultaneously
- Browser extension or mobile app versions

## Dependencies

- Access to web content via HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Network connectivity for accessing external URLs
- Content extraction library or service capable of identifying main content vs. boilerplate

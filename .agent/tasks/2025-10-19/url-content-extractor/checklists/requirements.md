# Specification Quality Checklist: URL Content Extractor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been verified:
- Specification contains no implementation details (no frameworks, languages, or specific libraries mentioned)
- Focus remains on user value (extracting readable content from URLs)
- All mandatory sections are complete with concrete details
- 12 functional requirements are clear and testable
- 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases identified (authentication, JavaScript content, redirects, etc.)
- Scope clearly bounded (excludes PDFs, authentication, batch processing)
- Assumptions and dependencies documented

## Notes

Specification is ready to proceed to `/plan` phase. No clarifications needed as all requirements are sufficiently detailed for planning.
